# Visual Identities

This repository showcases visual identity projects developed across two roles:

- **Designer** – execution-focused branding systems, logo creation, and asset development.
- **Creative Director** – concept development, brand strategy, and visual direction.

Each folder contains curated projects reflecting the scope and responsibilities of the respective role.
